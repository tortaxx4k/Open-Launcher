## Use from source

To use Open Launcher with the sourcecode, please follow these steps

  - Step 1 : Download the sourcecode (Open-Launcher-Main.zip)
  - Step 2 : Extract it to the location that you want to use
  - Step 3 : Double click on **main.py**

If the app dont launch, please paste this command into a cmd.

  ```bash
pip install Pyside6 requests supabase
  ```

> [!CAUTION]
> The official supabase ANON key is present on the sourcecode  
> This is normal. In order to make Open Launcher free and  
> Easy to use for everyone, you can connect your own version
> of Open Launcher with the rest  
> Of the community!

You can use your own supabase postgress SQL. This is how to setup the DB.  

You will need to execute these 2 commands to create the required DBs  

Games table creation :

```sql
create table games (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  author text not null,
  description text,
  image_url text,
  download_url text,
  donation_enabled boolean default false,
  donation_link text
);
```

Users table creation :

```sql
create table users (
    pseudo text primary key,
    password_hash text not null
);
```

And now, you will have to replace the default ANON key by yours on **api.py**

faites ca automatiquement en creeant un fichier .env avec votre URL de database notée DATABASE_URL et executez py new.py et tout est bon :-)
